Twelephone - VoiceMail Recording
==================================
Twelephone is the world's first HTML5 WebRTC (Real Time Communications) browser-based voice and video social network telephone! We are building the next generation web and mobile communications platform delivering secure, peer-to-peer, realtime conversations with high-definition voice, video, and instant messaging chat.

Phono & Tropo
-----------------------------------
The WebRTC recording API is still under development.  In the mean time, we are leveraging the Phono (http://phono.com) and Tropo (http://tropo.com) services from VoxeoLabs.

This is the script that we are running on Tropo to record the audio file and stream it to Twelephone.
